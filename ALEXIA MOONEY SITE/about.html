                <p class="lexbout">	Alexia Mooney is a fiber artist <br>
                    based out of Atlanta, Georgia. She is working on<br> 
                    achieving her bachelorâ€™s in fine arts in Studio Arts <br>
                    with a concentration in Textiles with a minor in <br>
                    Theatre Design at Georgia State University. Alexia's <br>
                    work tends to be very detail orientated, but she also <br>
                    focuses on new techniques and mixed media. Alexia <br>
                    started off focusing on music and technical theatre but <br>
                    switched to fine art while attending an accredited university. <br> 
                    Alexia finds inspiration in everyday life, from human interaction <br>
                    to the color of the sky. She also draws a lot of inspiration from <br>
                    different historical events. Most of her current work is <br>
                    focusing on the African American experience. While young, Alexia <br>
                    enjoyed doing art, crafts, and sewing- which she learned <br>
                    from her mother and grandmother. Alexia makes art as a creative <br>
                    outlet, source of information, and to get people talking about <br>
                    controversial topics. Alexia posts most of her current and old <br>
                    work on her Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_lexcr8_/" target="_blank" id="lexig1">@_lexcr8_</a>
                     or her YouTube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LBMsingz" target="_blank" id="lexyt1">Lexia Moon</a>.</p>
