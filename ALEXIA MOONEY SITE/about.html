                <p class="lexbout">	Alexia Mooney is a fiber artist based out of Atlanta, Georgia. She is working on<br> 
                    achieving her bachelorâ€™s in fine arts in Studio Arts with a concentration in Textiles<br> 
                    with a minor in Theatre Design at Georgia State University. Alexia's work tends to be <br>
                    very detail orientated, but she also focuses on new techniques and mixed media. Alexia <br>
                    started off focusing on music and technical theatre but switched to fine art while <br>
                    attending an accredited university. Alexia finds inspiration in everyday life, from <br>
                    human interaction to the color of the sky. She also draws a lot of inspiration from <br>
                    different historical events. Most of her current work is focusing on the African American <br>
                    experience. While young, Alexia enjoyed doing art, crafts, and sewing- which she learned <br>
                    from her mother and grandmother. Alexia makes art as a creative outlet, source of information, <br>
                    and to get people talking about controversial topics. Alexia posts most of her current and old <br>
                    work on her Instagram <link >@_lexcr8_</link> or her YouTube at Lexia Moon.
